This repository includes all of my personal dotfiles and binaries, I use on a daily basis.
First of all, the .bashrc tries to source my aliases, functions and things like
global definitions or special things like liquidprompt and exports user specific
paths.

My .bash_aliases contains many customized commands to facilitate my work.
The purpose of .bash_functions is to keep the same working experience on diffrent
systems. It's a collection of pseudo commands that work on many platforms.

Configuration files for vim, terminator and liquidprompt are also included.
setup.sh basically creates symlinks and takes care of already existing files.
