This repository includes all of my dotfiles and binaries, I use on a daily basis.
First of all, .bashrc tries to source my aliases, functions and things like
global definitions or special things like liquidprompt and exports user specific
paths.

My .bash_aliases contains many customized commands to facilitate my work.
The purpose of .bash_functions is to keep the same working experience on diffrent
systems.
Configuration files for vim, terminator and liquidprompt are also included.

setup.sh takes care of already existing files and copies new ones to their correct
locations.
